This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*.

DISP <- (sum(residuals(res_poisson, type='pearson')^2)/degrees_freedom(res_poisson_clustered, type = "resid"))
#DISP much larger than one, so this dataset is overdispersed. We want to account for this because while overdispersion won't change out estimate is, our standard error will be underestimated. If our standard error is underestimated that means our p-value will be too small, which can give us a false positive, or retun a statistically significant result that's not really statistically significant. A quasipoisson model can help us account for overdispersion.

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
